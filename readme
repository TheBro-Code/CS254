NOTE :- The co-ordinates are being read from the board swtiches, and are NOT hard coded.

How to Run :

We have made changes(and included them in the submission) in the following files :- 

1) main.c
2) cksum_rtl.vhdl
3) encrypter.vhdl
4) decrypter.vhdl
5) hdlmake.cfg (in the same directory as cksum_rtl.vhdl)
6) board.ucf has not been changed
7) debouncer.vhd (given in the earlier labs)

So in order to run our code, replace the following files 

1) main.c in ~/20140524/makestuff/apps/flcli.
2) cksum_rtl.vhdl, hdlmake.cfg in ~/20140524/makestuff/hdlmake/apps/makestuff/swled/cksum/vhdl/.
3) Also include encrypter.vhdl,debouncer.vhd and decrypter.vhdl in ~/20140524/makestuff/hdlmake/apps/makestuff/swled/cksum/vhdl/

After that run these commands in order

cd ~/20140524/makestuff/apps/flcli
make deps
cd ~/20140524/makestuff/hdlmake/apps/makestuff/swled/cksum/vhdl/
../../../../../bin/hdlmake.py -t ../../templates/fx2all/vhdl -b atlys -p fpga
sudo ../../../../../../apps/flcli/lin.x64/rel/flcli -v 1d50:602b:0002 -i 1443:0007
sudo ../../../../../../apps/flcli/lin.x64/rel/flcli -v 1d50:602b:0002 -p J:D0D2D3D4:fpga.xsvf
sudo ../../../../../../apps/flcli/lin.x64/rel/flcli -v 1d50:602b:0002 -s

 We have already included the print commands in main.c file which can be seen on terminal during execution which direct the control flow. 

 We have chosen following values:

 Ack1 : 01010011010001010100111001000100
 Ack2 : 01001110010101010100010001000101
 Key :  10001010011001011100101001010101
